# DungeonGenerator
#*Under Construction*
This program procedurally generates the floor layout for a dungeon. 
Intended to be used for a 3D roguelike game I'm creating in Unreal Engine 4.

# *Note
I should write instructions on how to setup GLFW and GLEW and Visual studio here.
Using a CMAKE project would also work but that's a pain.
